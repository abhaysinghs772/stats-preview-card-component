## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is my very first project that i have created from scratch "by my own" & "by figuring out things by my own".

- I got to know about how to make responsive website by using "media queries".
- About flexbox.
- And last but not least, i got to know the real progress happens when we do something outside of our comfort zone. I challenged my-self to complete this challenge without using any libraries like bootstrap or sass or less, because i wanted to know how to make a website responsive using pure css.

### Continued development

I will continue to work with "media query" and various other aspects of css like css-grid and flex-box

### Useful resources

- [flex-box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc) - This tutorial helped me to understand what really is flex-box, and i'm still learning.
